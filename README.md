# Some questionsï¼š

Dear Margaret and Jeff,

How are you! I am Jing Lyu and my UNI is jl6049. I have some questions about problem 3 of homework 3.

The comments on my solution of problem 3 are "-0.5 days should be factor, -1 should pivot wider table for readability, -1 last plot should be grouped by day". I discuss this problem with my classmate and I want to ask several questions accordingly.

I wonder If the "days" column is necessary to be factor since it is not asked me to do it in homework requirements. Also, my classmate does not get this deduction in his homework 3.
I am not sure which kind of pivot wider table that I need to do. And a classmate that does the same thing with me does not get this deduction. However, I would appreciate it if you could point out the place that I could improve the readability as I am happy to learn!
I am confused about the reason why I need to group when making a plot. Would you explain this to me more and maybe could take the plot in question 3 as an example.
Above are all my questions. Thanks for your patience and looking forward to your early reply.


Best,
Jing



Hi Jing,
The main variable transformations we were looking for: ensure minutes are numeric/correctly ordered and convert day of the week to a sensibly ordered factor. Students received point deduction if those tasks were not completed -- if your friend didn't, that was an oversight on our end

For the table, the comment was mostly addressing the format of your table. We were looking for a tidy and readable table (week as rows and days as columns) -- this is why grouping by week and day then pivoting wider would have been useful. I've attached the type of table we were looking for. Much easier to navigate and read than your table with lots of rows. Again, if your friend had a similar table to you, they should have received the point deduction

This was an error on our end -- you will receive the 1 point back

Best,
Margaret
